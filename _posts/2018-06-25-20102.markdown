The company that authored a watershed report on how Chinese hackers operate is pushing back against claims in a new book that the research was conducted through the use of illegal offensive hacking techniques.In The Perfect Weapon: War, Sabotage, and Fear in the Cyber Age,  New York Times national security correspondent David Sanger writes that the U.S.-based cybersecurity firm Mandiant penetrated a Chinese military cyber unit after it hacked into one of its customers systems in order to nail down attribution.According to Sanger, while Mandiant observed Chinese hackers breaching a client several years ago, they used it as an opportunity to target the attackers systems, which allowed access to a video camera that exposed the hackers faces:The passage continues:Mandiant, a subsidiary of cybersecurity giant FireEye, denied the books claims in a Mr. Sangers description of how Mandiant obtained some of the evidence underlying APT1 has resulted in a serious mischaracterization of our investigative efforts, the statement notes. To state this unequivocally, Mandiant did not employ hack back techniques as part of investigation of APT1, does not hack back in our incident response practice, and does not endorse the practice of hacking back.'The famous Subsequent similar research reports from other prominent and capable cybersecurity firms, including CrowdStrike and Dell SecureWorks, has served to further explain in recent years the ways in which China deploys hacking tools to steal intellectual property and U.S. national security secrets.Readers highlighted the passage on social media, resulting in additional backlash for FireEye.Fourth party collection  Costin Raiu (@craiu) The books claim is especially significant, because of how the U.S. government has cited the APT1 report in policy over the last five years. It essentially provided the government with a way to publicly shame China, without exposing any of its own technical sources or methods. Though senior U.S. officials have repeatedly backed Mandiants findings, theyve done little to independently release declassified research to support its conclusions.CyberScoop spoke with several current and former FireEye employees who criticized the books passage, suggesting Sanger misinterpreted what he saw. The employees spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak for the company.However, another passage from the book describes the outfits of the hackers he witnessed through computer cameras allegedly compromised by Mandiant:Sanger did not respond to a request for comment.Some industry insiders told CyberScoop they were less than shocked by the claims. Broadly speaking, hacking back to gain novel insight into an attacker is fairly well known, despite it being illegal under U.S. law. The practice is often the subject of commonplace rumors amongst the industry.The dispute also comes during a pertinent moment in time. Public concerns over the geopolitical allegiances of global technology companies has become ever more present.Recent legislation banned Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab from doing business with the federal government due to reported national security risks. Additionally, lawmakers are currently pushing a bill that would place restrictions on business between U.S. suppliers and Chinese telecom companies ZTE and Huawei.
