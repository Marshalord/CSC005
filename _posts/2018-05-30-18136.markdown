Two lawsuits filed by the Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab were dismissed Wednesday, ending the Moscow-based companys attempt to lift the U.S. governments ban on its products.Kaspersky filed the lawsuits after its products were banned from U.S. government systems in both a Binding Operational Directive from the Department of Homeland Security and the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act. That ban goes into effect on Oct. 1, 2018.The NDAA does not inflict punishment on Kaspersky Lab, Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, U.S. District Judge for the District of Columbia, wrote in her opinion. It eliminates a perceived risk to the nations cybersecurity and, in so doing, has the secondary effect of foreclosing one small source of revenue for a large multinational corporation.The basis of Kasperskys lawsuit was that the bans were unconstitutional and caused undue harm to the company.The ban is constitutional, the judge concluded.These defensive actions may very well have adverse consequences for some third-parties, she wrote. But that does not make them unconstitutional.Kollar-Kootelly said that theoretical harm to Kasperskys reputation is too vague and unsubstantiated' to warrant action.The judge also waved off Kasperskys protests about its right to sell to the government as worthless.This asserted right is worthless, she wrote. To sell requires another to buy. Because no government agency would buy Plaintiffs product in the period before October 1, 2018, Plaintiffs theoretical right to sell has no value at all in the real world.You can read the full opinion below.
