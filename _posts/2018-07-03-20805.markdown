tttI was born and raised in a beautiful city in Northeast China called Dalian. Its a small town  with about 7 million people. One of the reasons I love my hometown is because this where my career started. I was selected as the second intern in 2008 to work at the first wafer fab in Dalian. I soon joined on full time, and it was here that I realized my passion for technology and people, and how technology changes peoples lives.Later, while working in Shanghai, I happened to be on a business trip to the United States in the bustling city of San Francisco. I fell in love, and knew I needed to be even closer to the tech industry  and more specifically, Silicon Valley. Additionally, I developed a passion for people, culture, and community and wanted to become a well-rounded, strategic HR professional. In 2014 I started my MBA at the University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business in hopes of making this dream come true.While I was introduced to many opportunities during this time and loved Southern California  I was determined to end up in Silicon Valley. So you can imagine my excitement when I saw that Cisco would be recruiting at USC for their Cisco HR Leadership Program (HRLP). This program was exactly what I had dreamed of!The HRLP is a program designed for MBA students who have 3-5 previous work experiences, and a passion for HR and technology. I knew immediately that I wanted to be a part of this award winning, well-structured program that was known both internally and externally at Cisco.From my first meeting at the Cisco Glendale office, to going through the interview process  I realized how genuinely nice everyone was. They were welcoming and approachable, and my desire to join Cisco grew with every person I spoke with. Finally, during my second interview, I was offered the role and I nearly jumped out of my chair!That summer at Cisco was incredible as I formed meaningful relationships, went on team outings with my co-workers, and at the end of our rotation we were prepared to give our final Suitcase Presentations to the HR leadership, included Chief People Officer Fran Katsoudas!I was impressed with Ciscos culture (the sense of community employees have here is undeniable) and, after the summer had ended, I was thrilled to receive an offer from the HRLP on my first day back to campus. While many of my MBA classmates were waiting anxiously for an offer before graduation, I accepted an offer almost immediately and enjoyed a pressurefree second year during my MBA where I worked on all kinds of fun projects and traveled around the world!Currently, Im in my second rotation in Engineering Groups, and living my dream as an HR partner where I get to help business leaders and executives solve challenges within the organization. Every day is different with new problems and new opportunities.So before an interview or finding a job, ask yourself  what are your hopes, dreams, and ambitions? What motivates you? What is the one purpose for you in your life? Then go chase those dreams!The HRLP at Cisco is a place that I can always challenge myself and when I feel like Im To build your network, you have to practice give and take. Be a giver and help others when you can. At the same time, dont be afraid to ask for help too! Youll be surprised of the connections formed here.Its been a long journey from my hometown in China to Silicon Valley, but I am so excited to embrace the future and be a part of how Cisco changes the way we live, work, learn, and play.Heres to making your dreams come true, too!To find out more about Cisco HR Leadership Program, We'd love to hear from you!
