With the deadline fast approaching SMBs are reminded of what is required to become compliant tttttttttttttttBenjamin Franklin famously once said, By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail  a piece of wisdom that can be applied directly to any discussion on Although we have been covering this topic for the last WeLiveSecurity spoke with David Tomlinson, Manager of ESET Endpoint Encryption, who has spent time analysing the impact of GDPR requires any business inside or outside the European Union (EU) that collects or in any other way handles the personal data of EU citizens to be compliant with all its regulations and abide any legal implications resulting from non-compliance.With its complex rules and fines for non-compliance climbing to 20 million or more, GDPR penalties demand a financial outlay that is not easy to cover for any SMBs. With staff headcounts varying from 10 to 250 and annual turnover reaching between 2-50 million, the impact on their profit would be catastrophic.Ideally companies need to have dedicated personnel for creation of documentation, processes, procedures, someone overseeing the whole business in relation to GDPR, and lastly staff to implement it into the daily lives of employees. This is something that cannot be easily stowed in a structure of a smaller businessAs a Nevertheless, this is not a lost battle.

None of them will magically solve all your problems at once  but it is safe to say it will solve the majority of them when set up correctly.Security of USB sticks and laptops plays an important role, as these sometimes can become lost or stolen, leading to the loss of customer data, HR files, etc. that are stored on them  if the data are not encrypted. If you invest in easy-to-use encryption software for your business to store and work with the personal data safely, you are close to a win, concludes Tomlinson.For more information on GDPR, ESET has a
