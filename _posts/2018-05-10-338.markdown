"Fortunately, the current attack payloads from muhstik, mirai, hajime, and satori, have been tested to be broken and will not implant malicious code [...] and mettle's C2 server is now offline, although it could really finish the implant during its appearance," said the researchers.The routers, developed by The company said, however, that it does "not have direct insight to the total number of units that are still actively used in the field."Even though its routers are under attack, DZS has indicated that it will not fix the vulnerabilities, but will work "with each customer to help them assess methods to address the issue for units that may still be installed in the field."
