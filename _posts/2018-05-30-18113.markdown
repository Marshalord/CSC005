The developers of one of the top-traded cryptocurrencies, EOS, say theyve patched a critical vulnerability that reportedly could have compromised EOSs entire forthcoming platform.Chinese security company Qihoo 360 said in a Tuesday In a Once the malicious code takes control of a relevant server, an attacker could then pack the malicious contract into new block (sic) and further control all nodes of the EOS network.Qihoo 360 warns that because of the distributed nature of blockchain technology, compromising one node can put the whole system at risk. In the vulnerability Qihoo 360 reported, attackers could steal private keys to cryptowallets, control transactions, view private data and hijack EOS nodes to cryptopmine or conduct a denial of service attack.Due to the decentralized computing architecture, a security hole in a single blockchain node can compromise the whole network, the researchers wrote.While EOS hasnt actually launched its mainnet yet, its already been distributing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain for sale and trade. The EOS mainnet is Daniel Larimer, EOSs chief technology officer, Lattimer appeared to downplay the severity of the flaw discovered by Qihoo in a series of messages posted Tuesday to Twitter.Dan Larimer confirms the Epic EOS vulnerability is fixed and the reporting is FUD.
