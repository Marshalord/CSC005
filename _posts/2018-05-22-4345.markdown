In some circumstances, it may be possible for an attacker to intercept or create an administration session and change settings on your router. The reports appear to show that DNS settings are being altered. Specific improvements have been identified as necessary to combat this and we are in the process of producing and issuing new firmware. You should install that as soon as possible.DrayTek urged users in the meantime to check their DNS settings and correct them if altered or restore them from a config back-up.We also recommend only using secured (TLS1.2) connections for web admin (for local and remote admin) and disable remote admin unless needed, or until firmware is updated, The affected models are: Vigor2120; 2133; 2760D; 2762; 2832; 2860; 2862; 2862B; 2912; 2925; 2926; 2952; 3200; 3220; BX2000; 2830nv2; 2830; 2850; and 2920.There are thought to be in the region of 800,000 DrayTek routers in the wild globally, although its not known how many are vulnerable to the bug."In order to mitigate or prevent attacks prior to patching hardware, security teams should pay heed to their threat intel feeds, which will include blacklisted domains/IP addresses, and make sure this data is applied in a timely manner, he added. Blocking known bad identifiers is a game of cat and mouse, but it is an effective way of severing connections to servers which are out to abuse your users. Also monitoring for changes to configuration files or DNS traffic being sent to new or unexpected servers would give an alert that something might require remediation."
