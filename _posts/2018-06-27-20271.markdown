Unlike a text message code sent to your phone that can be intercepted and used, a universal two-factor keyfob requires a user to physically push a button to authorize a login.Because an associated key will also only work on genuine Twitter pages, it still helps protect against fake phishing pages that try to steal your password.(Image: file photo)That can help prevent remote attacks from skilled attackers on the other side of the world.Twitter said that in order to set up a physical two-factor key, that user's account must be associated with a mobile phone number -- another new measure that Twitter is requiring of all new accounts, the company "This is an important change to defend against people who try to take advantage of our openness," said Twitter.
