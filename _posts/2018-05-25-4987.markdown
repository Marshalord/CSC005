Thats understandable, given the WannaCry attack of May 2017 devastated large parts of the NHS, leading to an estimated 19,000 cancelled operations and appointments.Worryingly, over a quarter (26%) of respondents claimed they dont have an incident response plan in place  something required by the new GDPR.In addition, 28% said their healthcare organization (HCO) doesnt even have chief information security officer (CISO).A recent report from Answering questions on the insider threat, respondents to the Imperva poll said they were most concerned about careless users (51%). While 27% claimed a lack of tools to monitor employees and other activities makes detecting insider threats difficult.Attackers understand the value of the data held by healthcare organizations, and as a result, they are quickly becoming a sweet spot for hackers looking to steal large amounts of patient records for profit, argued There have been a number of incidents recently where cybercrime has impacted hospitals and left them unable to access patient data, which demonstrates the consequences of a successful attack. It is crucial that healthcare organizations take steps to protect their data. To retain patient trust, organizations must provide an excellent defense at all times.
