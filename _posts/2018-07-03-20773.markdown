 t tThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has been advised by the Executive Branch to deny China Mobile entry to the United States telecommunications industry, citing "substantial and unacceptable risk to US law enforcement and foreign intelligence collection". t tThe Executive Branch, which includes the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, Defense, State, and Commerce, along with the Offices of Science and Technology Policy and the US Trade Representative, made the recommendation almost seven years after China Mobile International (USA) made the application for a certificate under s214 of thet t t t"After significant engagement with China Mobile, concerns about increased risks to US law enforcement and national security interests were unable to be resolved," Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information at the US Department of Commerce David J Redl said. t t"Therefore, the Executive Branch of the US government, through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration pursuant to its statutory responsibility to coordinate the presentation of views of the Executive Branch to the FCC, recommends that the FCC deny China Mobile's Section 214 license request." t tAt t tAccording to the Executive Branch, while it "strongly supports" the FCC's policy to encourage international participation and therefore competition in the US telco market, "the deepening integration of the global telecommunications market has created risks and vulnerabilities". t t"In the current national security environment ... the authorisation would pose substantial, unacceptable national security and law-enforcement interests of the United States," the petition states. t t"The Executive Branch has assessed that China Mobile is vulnerable to exploitation, influence, and control by the Chinese government, and that China Mobile would likely comply with requests made by the Chinese government." t tIf permitted, China Mobile would gain access to phone lines, fibre-optic cables, mobile networks, and communications satellites, which the Executive Branch said were all "created with minimal security features because it was assumed that only trusted parties would have access". t tThe Executive Branch pointed to China's "record of intelligence activities and economic espionage targeting the United States" along with "China Mobile's size and technical and financial resources" in saying that the national security risk would only increase over time and could not be resolved through the mitigation strategies proposed by China Mobile. t t"The Executive Branch's recommendation to deny China Mobile's application is consistent with a broader law enforcement and national security effort to counter malicious Chinese cyber activity against the United States," the petition concluded. t t"The government must be able to trust that the information it provides to the carriers will be kept in confidence and used by the carrier solely for the purpose of protecting its network ... in part because China Mobile is majority-owned by the Chinese government, which the Executive Branch assigns responsibility for a significant amount of unlawful activity, including many cyber intrusions against the United States. t"China Mobile cannot serve as a trusted voice communication provider for these purposes." t tAt t t"Our local colleges are helping create the nation's first cyber army, and installations like Rome AFRL [Air Force Research Laboratory] are employing them to keep our nation safe and secure from cyber invaders, like the Chinese," Brindisi had written. t tAccording to at t tAt t t tUS President Donald Trump's administration has been cracking down on Chinese involvement, in May reportedly introducing draft legislation to force US tech companies to divulge whether they permit nations including China and Russia tot t t tEarlier that month,t t tIn addition, the draft legislation imposes higher taxes on any income from China being made by US multinational companies, as well as levelling duties and caps on shares held by Chinese investors in some US companies. t tThe heads of the CIA, FBI, NSA, and the director of national intelligence to the Senate Intelligence Committee had also recommended in February that Americanst t t tAftert t tTrump hadt t t"We have a trade deficit, depending on the way you calculate, of $504 billion, now some people would say it is really $375 billion," Trump said at the time, adding that the tariffs could hitt t t t"Frankly, it's going to make us a much stronger, much richer nation." t tThe Trump Administration is also considering setting standards for at t t tAccording to the documents, Huawei and ZTE have become leaders in 5G technology due to support from the Chinese government -- with China itself "the dominant malicious actor in the information domain". t t"Huawei has used market-distorting pricing and preferential financing to dominate the global market for telecommunications infrastructure. China sets aside up to 70 percent of its mobile infrastructure market for Huawei and ZTE, only allowing Western vendors to compete for the remainder," the alleged government memo says. t t"The magnitude of the Chinese market reserved to Huawei and ZTE allows the companies to effectively fund their RD with domestic sales while insulating the companies against global infrastructure spending downturns. The government has also extended an estimated $100 billion line of credit to Huawei to finance deals abroad. Combined with aggressive pricing, diplomatic support, and suspected payments to local officials, Huawei has quickly taken market share in the radio infrastructure market as well as optical and routing, leaving them poised to take market leadership of 5G." t tHuawei Australian chair John Lord last week said the Chinese technology giant is the most audited, inspected, reviewed, and critiqued IT company in the world, and hast t t t"After every kind of inspection, audit, review, nothing sinister has been found. No wrongdoing, no criminal action or intent, no 'back door', no planted vulnerability, and no 'magical kill switch'," Lord said. t t"In fact, in our three decades as a company no evidence of any sort has been provided to justify these concerns by anyone -- ever." t tChina Mobile, which earlier this week announced that it would be building itst t t tChina Mobile has also been working witht t t tFollowing the approval of 5G standards in December, China Mobile, Huawei, and ZTE -- alongside Ericsson, Intel, Nokia, Samsung, ATT, BT, China Telecom, China Unicom, Deutsche Telekom, Fujitsu, KT Corporation, LG Electronics, LG Uplus, MediaTek, NEC Corporation, NTT DoCoMo, Orange, Qualcomm, SK Telecom, Sony Mobile Communications, Sprint, TIM, Telefonica, Telia Company, T-Mobile USA, Verizon, and Vodafone -- had announced that the global mobile industry can begin thet t
