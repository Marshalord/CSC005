Two privacy-focused organizations have accused today German police of carrying out raids at their offices and members' private homes on some pretty shoddy reasoning that makes no sense and hints at the police's abuse of power.The first of these organizations is One of the ways it helps these projects includes collecting donations from European users into its bank account and then relaying the raised money to overseas projects.Today, members of the Zwiebelfreunde project revealed that German police had raided their Dresden office and the homes of three members located in the cities of Augsburg, Jena, and Berlin.The raids took place on June 20, and police told Zwiebelfreunde members they were in relation to the RiseUp project, a provider of anonymous XMPP and email services.Officers told members that they were looking for information on the owner of a RiseUp email address. Officers said the owner of that email address registered a site (named Naturally, police were looking for the man behind those threats.But the Zwiebelfreunde group claims police went about it the wrong way. Instead of going after the RiseUp project, they went after their organization instead."We have nothing to do with RiseupÂ’s infrastructure," said the Zwiebelfreunde group today in a Members of the Chaos Computer Club (CCC), a famous German organization whose members are mostly security researchers and hardware hackers, put the things in perspective as for why the searches were so ludicrous.Yet, despite the flaw in logic that even police officers were aware, the home searches continued. According to Zwiebelfreunde, police seized electronic equipment from members, such as smartphones, laptops, PCs, GnuPG Smartcards/Yubikeys, hard drives, etc.Zwiebelfreunde says police overreached when they seized this equipment as most of it was the property of members and their family, and not the organization.Furthermore, police also overreached and broke their own search warrant when they confiscated legal and financial documents."Apart from encrypted media, they had the legal right to seize documents related to our Riseup bank account starting from January 2018," the group said."Despite our protests, they additionally seized all printed documents relating to our own and partner projects since the inception of the association in 2011," Zwiebelfreunde said, revealing that police collected data outside their initial scope."If you have ever donated to Torservers, or Tails or Riseup via a European bank transaction, your data is very likely now in the hands of the German police," Zwiebelfreunde members said. This includes IBAN account number, name of the account holder, donation amount and date.Zwiebelfreunde says it tried to get back the documents and equipment that were collected illegally but German police refused to return the seized items. German police also refused all inquiries for additional comment from German media."This is a textbook example of how easy the fundamental rights of completely innocent citizens and their families can be violated as a result of artificially constructed evidence chains, no matter how ridiculous. To be drawn into this as a witness on the basis of such patently unsustainable reasoning is questionable to say the least. The recent introduction of draconian Bavarian laws governing police authority has clearly led to a culture where those responsible no longer feel bound by any sense of proportionality of their actions," says Frank Rieger, speaker for the Chaos Computer Clubs (CCC).But things didn't end here. In a According to the CCC, police searched its OpenLab in Augsburg, where they found hackers and computer experts working on electronic boards, surrounded by equipment and chemical substances needed to create such custom boards.The CCC explains what happened on that day:German media reported the three CCC members who were arrested were later released on the same day without being charged."Just like with the initial suspicion with regard to the board members of Zwiebelfreunde, the subsequent suspicions with regard to explosives are incompetent, malicious or both," the CCC says."The suspicion of 'preparation of a explosive attack' is a grave and direct threat to the operation of a hackerspace - family-friendly OpenLab is open to visitors almost every day."If the mere possession of basic chemical knowledge is a cause for suspicion then pretty soon teenagers will have to hide their chemistry books from nosy cops.
