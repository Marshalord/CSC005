"As the investigation unfolded, though, it learned that the user accounts were never the target of the attack. The cyber-attack corrupted the master boot records (MBRs) of 9,000 PCs and servers, leaving them unable to be rebooted. Multiple branch computer systems were inoperable, though online systems remained up and running, according to What appeared to be a virus was actually MBR Killer malware, according to Because the bank took measures to safeguard customer accounts by disconnecting approximately 9,000 workstations believed to be infected, attackers were able to steal millions of dollars from the bank."We found some strange transactions in the SWIFT system (where banks internationally remit their transactions to different countries).
