A botnet discovered at the start of the year and named This is an important development in the botnet's evolution, which also passed a significant milestone in May when it became the first IoT malware that was capable of Now, the Netlab research team at Qihoo 360 says that HNS has expanded beyond the scope of routers and DVRs and is now also targeting database applications running on server operating systems.According to Netlab researchers, the botnet is now capable of infecting the following types of devices, with the following types of exploits:As a side-effect for adding more payloads, HNS is also noisier now, as it needs to scan more ports to find new hosts to infect. Experts say they've seen HNS bots initiating scans on ports:But HNS was easy to spot anyway because it's only the second major IoT botnet besides Hajime known to use a P2P structure, so security researchers would have an easy time identifying it regardless.HNS is not the first botnet to target OrientDB servers, which have become quite the favorite among various botnets. For example, DDG, a botnet In fact, it appears that HNS operators might have learned something from the DDG crew because Netlab says HNS has also started dropping a coinminer payload on some of the infected systems.Fortunately, for the time being, it appears that these deployments have all failed, as the additional coinminer payload failed to start and generate funds for the HNS operators.But if they manage to get it up and running, they'll be in for some profits, as the DDG gang collected well over $1 million from their coinmining last year.
