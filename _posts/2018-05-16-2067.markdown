Members of the public could be tracked, located and identified  or misidentified  everywhere they go, warned Big Brother Watch director, Silkie Carlo.Were seeing ordinary people being asked to produce ID to prove their innocence as police are wrongly identifying thousands of innocent citizens as criminals. It is deeply disturbing and undemocratic that police are using a technology that is almost entirely inaccurate, that they have no legal power for, and that poses a major risk to our freedoms.The campaign has the backing of MP David Lammy and 15 rights and race equality groups including Liberty, Article 19 and the Race Equality Foundation.Big Brother Watch also raised a wider issue of police handling of custody images, claiming that the photos of innocent members of the public are still kept on file even if theyre released without charge.They can then end up on the Police National Database and be turned into facial biometrics used to identify individuals via specialized software. The rights group argues that police should delete such images as they do fingerprints and DNA once an individual is found to be innocent or released without charge.
