Interestingly, the flagged files were digitally signed using a valid D-Link Corporation code-signing certificate. The exact same certificate had been used to sign non-malicious D-Link software; therefore, the certificate was likely stolen, After being notified of the discovery, D-Link revoked the certificate last week, he added.However, BlackTech is still using the Changing Information Technology certificate, despite it also having been revoked last week.Kevin Bocek, chief cybersecurity officer at If you steal trusted machine identities from global technology companies, you can execute highly effective attacks that dont raise any alarms. This is just one more demonstration of how machine identities, in this case code signing certificates, are being abused by malicious actors. Theres no doubt were going to see a lot more of these attacks in the future, he added.Code-signing certificates are often a core component of DevOps and cloud infrastructure; and because organizations are using a lot more machine identities, these risks will only grow. In fact, researchers are already seeing a dramatic rise in the trade of stolen code-signing certificates on the dark web.
