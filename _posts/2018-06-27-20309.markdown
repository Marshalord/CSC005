Victims of a destructive form of ransomware, which fails to unlock files even if the ransom is paid, can now retrieve their files for free with a new file decryptor released by security researchers.Thanatos ransomware first started targeting Windows systems in February and multiple versions of it have been released in the months since, indicating that those behind it remain an active threat.Thanatos is distinct from many other forms of ransomware in that However, even if the victim does give into the ransom demand, issues within the encryption process of Thanatos means that the data isn't returned to the victim. Some campaigns reveal that this is intentional on part of the attackers, who taunt victims about the lack of a decryption key. In order to combat the destruction caused by files which can't be decrypted,Like other forms of ransomware, Thanatos is delivered to victims in the form of an attachment, although it isn't restricted to email as attackers have been seen distributing the ransomware by Discord, a voice and text chat application "Chat platforms provide a direct communications path between an attacker and a potential victim and the nature of real-time chat also provides a means for an attacker to not only distribute their In the case of delivery by Discord, victims are tricked into downloading a file called 'fastleafdecay.exe' which poses as a mod for game Minecraft - but is in fact the ransomware, which reveals itself via a basic ransom note - and a rude message telling the victim their files can't be decrypted.A version of the Thanatos ransom note which doesn't even offer the prospect of decryption.Those behind Thanatos have built it from the ground up and may not have the capabilities to actually provide encryption keys to victims who pay - but they nonetheless continue to distribute the ransomware.It's possible that those behind the campaign turned to this form of attack because their initial ransomware campaign wasn't very successful - analysis of the attackers's cryptocurrency wallets suggests that they've only received $720 for ransomware which has been active for six months.With many more successful and advanced forms of ransomware are "The attacker may have viewed creating and distributing this as an exercise to improve their skill and ability to create future malware," said Brumaghin.Nonetheless, "It is important to take security seriously and take steps to secure your systems, whether they are used for personal or business purposes," said Brumaghin. "Since many of these attacks take advantage of users, you also need to be careful when opening attachments from unknown sources or clicking on unknown links".
