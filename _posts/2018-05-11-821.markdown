Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon whose work often focuses on tech and privacy, senttWyden said the system allows police and government employees to conduct unauthorized and warrantless surveillance, and it "needlessly exposes millions of Americans to potential abuse and surveillance by the government." tSecurus said it required an "official document giving permission" to obtain real-time location data, but Wyden's office said that Securus officials make no effort to verify the purported authorizations. tSecurus provides this real-time location data through a self-service portal for police, said Wyden, for "nothing more than the legal equivalent of a pinky promise." tWyden also sent In a blog post, the ACLU said the system is "ripe for abuse.""The FCC should also immediately investigate Securus and any companies that provide similar services.

"Additionally, they must take steps to ensure that telecommunications providers themselves adequately safeguard data from this type of abuse." tThe cell carriers are investigating, the report said.
