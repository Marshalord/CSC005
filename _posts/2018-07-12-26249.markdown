WorkforceThe Defense Information Systems Agency has awarded a $49 million other transaction agreement (OTA) to develop to prototype a shared service for federal background investigations.Â DISA announced on July 9 that Enterprise, LLC, a Herndon, Va.-based firm, received the award on June 22.Â  The planned system, called the National Background Investigation Services Investigation Management Shared Service, aims to be an "integrated case management solution that will bring together the core functions Â and provide the interface for investigative users," DISA officials said.National Background Investigation Services, or NBIS, is the DOD organization OTAs elsewhere in DOD have drawn criticism, but DISA is defending the approach as the best way to "acquire leading-edge technologies by tapping into a non-traditional defense contractor base."ÂWeÂre building a first-of-its-kind enterprise system that brings together the complex integration of a number of disparate systems on an unprecedented scale," NBIS Program Manager Raju Shah said.Â  "We needed to hear from as wide a selection of vendors as possible to understand what was possible and be able to narrow to whatÂs probable."Other firms on the Enterprise team include Accenture Federal Services, Next Tier Concepts, Pegasystems and Torch Research.About the Author Prior to joining 1105 Media in 2012, Schneider was the New America FoundationÂs Director of MediaTechnology, and before that was Managing Director for Electronic Publishing at the Atlantic Media Company.
