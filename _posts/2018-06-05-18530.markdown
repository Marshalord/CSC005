In an industry that tends to be quiet by design, a new international firm is deliberately making noise.Headquartered in the United Arab Emirates, The big money comes paired with an earnest promise of transparency that is unique in an industry where secrecy is standard operating procedure.Crowdfense director Andrea Zapparoli Manzoni told CyberScoop that he wants to do things differently.The zero-day industry uncovers  through research or by purchase  exploits in computer systems and then sells them to the highest bidder. Many governments and even some private companies are involved in the business. Crowdfense shares a lot in common with its closest competitor Zerodium didnt respond to a request for comment.Oppressive regimes can turn the potent tools against their own citizens while these developers rake in the cash. The well-known companies, like Israels NSO Group, make over $200 million in sales per year, according to one employee of that firm. Other big players include Italys HackingTeam and Germanys Gamma Group.This sector has no proper regulation, Manzoni said. All you can do is try to self-regulate and do no evil.Manzoni, an Italian citizen, wants to build a successful and decent zero-day business by following a set of self-imposed rules that focuses in on one point: We deal only with countries with track records of human rights respect.Manzoni says Crowdfense, which is headquartered in the tech-rich United Arab Emirates, does not sell to nondemocratic regimes. The company doesnt work with Asia or dictatorships and it tries to avoid selling to countries where revolutions and civil wars are going on.When tools get sold to nondemocratic countries, its inevitable that dictatorships will use it to go after their internal population, Manzoni said.Crowdfense also doesnt build mass surveillance tools, instead focusing on exploits that can be used in highly focused operations against less than a dozen targets, he said.The policy of avoiding selling zero-day exploits to certain countries certainly sets Crowdfense apart. But its an interesting choice for a company headquartered in a nondemocratic Asian country notorious for both its love of new and expensive technology alongside its longstanding and continuing In many ways, the UAE is a great place to start a business. Its home to the second-largest economy in the Persian Gulf region, fueled mostly by oil exports. The country offers extraordinary recruiting packages to foreign technology talent including tax exemptions and paid-for housing, food, health care, education and transportation. For tech startups hungry for both cash and talent, thats a hard package to ignore.The country is also known for its use of highly focused zero-day exploits to spy on and detain internationally-celebrated human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor, who was recently sentenced to 10 years in prison for insulting the country.Manzoni stressed that there is no way to know how the companys customers use its tools, due to the nature of their work. But its easier for us to vet our customers, he said, because the company is supporting actions like sting operations by law enforcement agencies rather than doing mass-surveillance work for the highest bidder.For a company throwing $10 million prizes into the public arena, questions quickly arose about the firms funding. The blog Intelligence Online When asked about the source of the companys funding, Manzoni declined to give a specific answer one way or the other despite the transparency plea. He did, however, say that part of the reason Crowdfense is headquartered in UAE is to attract better investment.We were funded by a pool of international investors, he said. Its a new way of doing this kind of thing so its a high risk that it wont work. Its a big question mark.
