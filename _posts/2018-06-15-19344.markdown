Medium-risk and then critical vulnerabilities followed, taking 77 days and 74 days respectively.NCC Group complained that too often vendors lack a clear point of contact for researchers to communicate with when they find a flaw, lengthening the delay. Sometimes out of desperation, researchers are even forced to contact the vendors social media team in order to find a secure communication channel, it added.NCC Group research director, Matt Lewis, bemoaned the lack of established processes for vulnerability remediation and disclosure. Just 2.4% of the vulnerabilities found by his team and reported resulted in a CVE.There also seems to be a false sense of security among businesses when it comes to low-risk vulnerabilities. These are vulnerabilities nonetheless, and were seeing an increase in bug chaining attacks, which exploit multiple low-risk issues across infrastructure to achieve full, unauthorized control of the underlying system, he added.The fact that the majority of vulnerabilities uncovered by our researchers over the past nine years have not been fixed demonstrates that there are likely far more zero-day vulnerabilities in existence than we might think.Separate research The WannaCry ransomware campaign of May 2017 highlighted just how many organizations fail to patch even critical bugs promptly.
