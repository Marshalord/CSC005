"They are ransomware-as-a service campaigns offering some interesting new features."An example Lyne pointed to was a web-based interface where you can set some options, customize the ransom price, the address and so on, click build and download and get delivered a nice, constructed up-to-date piece of malware that authors have put effort into making sure the security community isnt going to detect.Theyve even started giving security advice: we recommend you to download the file without the xe extension so you dont accidently run it!Another new ransomware service Lyne highlighted is one that is free for download and use  so we have fremium ransomware  who wants to pay for a service in 2018? You login, generate your malicious code and you distribute it, but the difference is, unlike the products and services of before where you owned the ransomware, its now an advertising referral scheme. So you generate your malware, you distribute it, and this other criminal gang receives the money and pays you 40% of the profits  so theres no upfront investment, no difficulties in dealing with the digital currency and potentially getting caught, you dont even own the people you hack anymore! Thats how commoditized we are  people have options on referral cuts on compromising our computers.
