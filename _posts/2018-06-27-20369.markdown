From January 1 until June 14, the day the World Cup matches began, we gathered up all of our data on registered threats per country, seeing which teams attracted the most attacks, and which slipped under the malware radar. Shall we take a look?We generally regard the winner of a game as the one who, well, wins. Score the most goals, beat the opponents, and move onto the next stage until victory is yours. That doesnt quite work when talking about malware attacks on a collection of nations, however. In our wacky realm of World Cupthemed malware antics, the winner is the loser, in a way.For example, do you think the nation being hammered with the most attacks is feeling like much of a champion?Perhaps your take is that the Maybe their infrastructure isnt as interesting to criminals as one belonging to a larger nation.

Trojans have another strong showing with 42,241 in totalthats a daily tally of about 280. Finally, we have a rousing performance from adware, who aimed 34,495 total threats at England at a pace of about 229 per day.Im guessing were still going out about five nil to Brazil, though.But what regular gameplay doesnt cover are the number of social engineering tactics deployed to countries participating in the World Cup (and others besides). Events garnering global attention also find what they dont seekfoul play.There have been some clever football-themed scams over the years, and its possible some of these may be brought out to score a last-minute goal for cybercrime. Lets take a look at some of the scams of World Cups past and how you can defend against them.We observed a number of scams released during the last World Cup, many of which used a gaming theme as they rode on the coattails of the enormously successful FIFA Football titles produced by EA. In 2018, football games are still incredibly popular, and its World Cup season once again.One such gaming scheme used social media accounts offering up Click to enlargeHeres the final destination, a phishing page harvesting gaming accounts:Click to enlargeFake football match streams are always popular, and we saw a wave of them at the last World Cup, the majority of which Click to enlargeIn 2014, we also saw a novel social engineering technique used, where fake support accounts dropped themselves into chats between customers and verified support channels, then Click to enlargeIn this case, it was a phish for the Origin gaming platform:Click to enlargeWhile the above was a fairly generic phish attack, many were specifically Click to enlargeAnother common tactic come World Cup time: fake Youre a winner! emails claiming millions of dollars and free tickets are waiting in the wings.
