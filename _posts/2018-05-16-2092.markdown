The damage caused by these successful threats confirms the need to address cybersecurity, the report reads.PA Consulting Group cited the following as trends that are increasing airports susceptibility to cyber-attacks: increased technology usage, hyper-connectivity, data-sharing obligations, customer centricity, IT/IoT towers, remote towers and airports as mega hubs.Fundamentally, the focus on physical security needs to be applied with the same rigor in the cyber-arena if airports are going to build resilience to potentially catastrophic cyber-attacks, said David Oliver, global transport security lead at PA Consulting Group. If the industry does not act now, it will find itself at increased vulnerability to cyber-attacks as new technologies become part of everyday operations.The report concludes by outlining the elements required to ensure airport cyber-resilience now and in the future:With the EU Network and Information Systems Directive, which aims to improve the cyber-resilience of the UKs essential services, now in force, UK airports risk penalties of up to Ł17m for failing to put in place appropriate cybersecurity measures, Oliver added.
