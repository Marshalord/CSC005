The Free Software Movement of India has The letter also highlights YouTube videos which claim to demonstrate how using a software patch to the ECMP software, geo-location and bio-metric security protection can be bypassed, similar to the one below that allow new Aadhaar enrolments without verification and updating of personal information of existing Aadhaar numbers. Such as this one:The FSMI terms call this a very serious concern as it endangers the sanctity of the entire Aadhaar database and asks whether the UIDAI authority has carried out an examination of these claims and if there is any merit to these claims.The letter also draws attention to a PayTM account mentioned in the YouTube video that was tracked down to a Bharat B.
