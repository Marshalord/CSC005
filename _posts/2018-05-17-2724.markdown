(Image: file photo)A bug that allowed two researchers to gain access to the backend systems of a popular internet-connected vehicle management system could have given a malicious hacker everything they needed to track the vehicle's location, steal user information, and even cut out the engine. tIntCar hacking has become a major focus in the security community in recent years, as more vehicles are hooked up to the cellular internet. But while convenient to control your car from your phone, it's also opened up new points for attack -- which could have real-world consequences. tYou might not even realize you're a Calamp user. Many apps, including the vehicle tracking app Viper SmartStart, which lets users locate, start, and control their car from their phone, connects to the outside world using a Calamp modem to its cloud-based servers.The researchers found thattUsing the same credentials as the app, the researchers were also able to log in and gain complete access to the Calamp server, the researchers saidt"You could easily exploit it and as we had full access to the database," said Stykas in an email. "We could do a lot of stuff -- pretty much any scenario that we could think of was disastrous, like mass stealing cars or turning off vehicle via panic button when going with a high speed," he said. tBy querying the database, Stykas said it was possible to find a car by looking up nearby latitude and longitude coordinates, reset the password, unlock the driver's side door, start the engine, and drive away.Calamp's back-end database.

They could also see usernames and masked passwords, but had no way to export the data. The bug was fixed after the researchers contacted the company. A spokesperson for Calamp said it patched the flaw and continues to investigate. "Calamp takes the matter of IT and data security seriously. Once we received the bug report, our team promptly investigated and developed a patch to address it. We believe that this matter has been resolved without issue," the spokesperson said. Calamp has since addedStykas said he wasn't sure how many companies or vehicles were affected by the server bug. Calamp saysIt's not the first instance of car hacking we've seen.
