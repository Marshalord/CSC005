The makers of Grand Theft Auto (GTA) Online mods have played a cruel prank on GTA gamers this week after they used their mods to show fake GTA 6 launch announcements to online gamers.Rockstar Games, the company behind the wildly popular game, dismissed the rumors."This is a hoax made with the use of mods, and not an official message or statement from Rockstar Games," the company tweeted several times during the past few days [The messages started appearing on users' screens while playing GTA Online circa July 2 and were only seen on desktops and Play Station 4 devices, the platforms that support mods.The message was a simple popup box that was shown in the bottom-left corner of a player's screen, with a simple text saying: "Rockstar Message: GTA VI Coming 2019 www.rockstargames.com"GTA gamers have been waiting for a new game in the series since 2013, when Rockstar launched GTA 5, so the community was more than ready to believe the hoax.Nonetheless, as an online gamer logically explained the hoax, Rockstar Games is very unlikely to release GTA 6 any time soon, as the company is prepping to launch Red Dead Redemption 2 later this fall. The gaming studio is known to leave lots of room between releases so games can get traction with their communities and turn optimal profits.Below are some tweets from the people who've seen and fell for the fake announcement.GTA VI Coming in 2019? Just saw this in game. GTA VI coming 2019!! Message receive on PC version of the game. Is this a hack or real? GTA6 coming in 2019 ?
