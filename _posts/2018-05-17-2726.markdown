According to Dragos, CHRYSENE has moved beyond email spear phishing and is now using strategic web compromise - watering holes - to exploit victims. Analysis after the 2012 attack revealed that the group appeared to have some degree of involvement in the 2016 Shamoon 2 attack and remains active in targeting the Arabian Gulf region and the Middle East.Currently, the groups primary mode of operation is to compromise IT and do reconnaissance against industrial organizations. Dragos has not seen evidence of this group having any ICS-specific capabilities that could damage critical infrastructure. But, they do target oil, gas and manufacturing companies, mostly in Europe and North America, and focus on network penetration. The group specializes in initial penetration  CHRYSENE compromises a target machine and passes the victim to another group for further exploitation. The group operates in Iraq, Pakistan, Israel, and the UK, and is an evolution of previous campaigns focusing exclusively on the Arabian Gulf region, wrote Caltagirone.Defenders might find success if they shift the focus to the "kill chain", said Caltagirone. "The initial access, lateral movement, and intelligence gathering process which takes months or years before any disruption. Organizations and defenders have a higher chance of discovering and remediating ICS threats earlier in this process before any disruption."
