Of the respondents, 28% of frontline workers focus on automation where 55% of CIO/CISO and management focus on automation.Less than half (40%) of SOCs are reportedly outsourced, but 95% outsource parts of the SOC. Of those that outsource in part, 45% outsource monitoring while 47% outsource detection. Only 5% of SOCs outsourced entirely.Without a connected SOC team, many operations ­teams arent able to protect themselves, which was especially noticeable around technology. Job functions had little impact on those who reported false positives and keeping up with security alerts as their top-of-mind concerns.A large majority (79%) of managers and frontline employees expressed frustration with outdated equipment. While a portion of survey participants (38%) wouldnt alter anything about the SOC, many would like to see changes. Of the total respondents, 17% would like to see changes around technology, 14% around staffing and 12% around processes.Nearly half of all respondents (4%) said that the volume of security alerts is the biggest pain point, which correlates with the high number of SOC professionals that believe their SOC is understaffed, with 63% of SOC professionals reporting that they could use anywhere from 2-10 more employees. Additionally, most SOC professionals have a longer tenure in IT than in the SOC.
