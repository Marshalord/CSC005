The mystery of the recent surge in port 8000 scan activity has been solved today by security researches from Qihoo 360 Netlab, who tracked this week's mystery traffic to an old foe According to researchers, the publication of proof-of-concept (PoC) code on June 8 for a popular web server software package drew the attention of the Satori crew, who integrated that particular exploit into their botnet's attack routine.The exploit allows an attacker to send a malformed package via ports 80 or 8000 and execute code on the device, effectively taking it over.Scans for devices that had port 8000 exposed via their WAN interface started a day after the PoC's publication but picked up yesterday, June 14. The sudden surge in port 8000 activity turned the heads of multiple security experts specialized in botnet tracking, as it came out of nowhere and at an incredible scale.What's up with all the 8000/tcp traffic? Bad Packets Report (@bad_packets) port 8000 scan is also jumping up now...stay tuned for more update Here's a link to the pcap file (traffic tofrom port 8000). Definitely captured some traffic but nothing jumped out to me as malicious. Unusual, but not malicious. Always possible that I missed something, though.  According to honeypot data from Naturally, scan activity targeting these two ports also grew similarly to the one seen on port 8000, and the Satori crew is trying to corral as many routers as it can before other botnets join the fold.After While some IoT botnets try to avoid the limelight by just re-routing traffic for other crooks, Satori is more of an in-your-face botnet, used to Indicators of compromise for the recent Satori versions are available in
