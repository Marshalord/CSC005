When a new domain gets registered we look at the Whois information and name and address.This In April, The ICANN statement said that a moratorium on enforcement action by data protection acts would potentially allow for the introduction of an agreed-upon accreditation model, and for the registries and registrars to implement the accreditation model in conjunction with the measures in the agreed final interim compliance model.A fragmented Whois would no longer employ a common framework for generic top-level domain (gTLD) registration directory services, ICANN said. Registries and registrars would likely implement varying levels of access to data depending on their interpretations of the law.Barlow explained that while a malicious registrant will not use their real name, but there will be some consistency if they register 1000 domains, so the phone number or email would be the same and when we detect one we can flag them all as bad, and this proliferates across the internet in minutes.Barlow said that losing the ability to know who registered a domain will hit the efficacy of malicious domain takedowns, and this could lead to two bad scenarios: one is where the amount of spam and attacks go up and companies block everything, including those who legitimately want to keep their details private; and the second issue will be more spam carrying malicious links or ransomware.This gives bad guys a free reign, as most domains are malicious, Barlow said. We need to filter them out, and the only way is with Whois.He concluded by saying that the cybersecurity industry can get in front of this, and monitor new domains and their activity as bad guys register domains anonymously and wait a few months so test it, put legit traffic on it and then flip it to be malicious.However, we can expect a lot of spam in a few months with no way to block it. Ironically the new privacy law could cause further loss through cyber-attack.
