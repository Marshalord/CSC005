According to the preliminary investigation, the limited data includes contact information, usernames and encrypted passwords. Adidas has no reason to believe that any credit card or fitness information of those consumers was impacted.Javvad Malik, security advocate at Without having monitoring controls in place, a company cannot say with certainty whether the claim of a breach is true or not, he added. This leads to any malicious party being able to claim that they have breached a company, even if they haven't, leading to unnecessary activity needing to be undertaken by the company and its customers, not to mention the potential lack of trust this creates."The announcement is just the latest in a string of recent breach incidents including the likes of Ticketmaster UK and Under Armour.The Fort Knox approach of making your organization impenetrable simply doesnt work today because so many third parties have access to your network, argued Fred Kneip, CEO, at It only takes a single vulnerability within any of those third parties to put sensitive data at risk.Its unclear whether any EU citizens are affected by the breach, in which case the relevant GDPR regulators will be looking closely at the case.
