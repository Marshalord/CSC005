It seems  Hacker Fantastic (@hackerfantastic) While Apple strives to make their iPhones harder and harder to breach, a security researcher published a brute-force vulnerability for iOS devices that he said cracked the security measures built into the system. However, Apple denied the researchers findings and the researcher acknowledged an error.Researcher By Saturday, after a slew of security experts inside and outside of Apple got involved, Hickey corrected the record. His full explanation of the error is below:Its basically a feature of the devices, he explained. If you send pin codes too quickly or send lots of duplicate entries, the devices dont actually test the pin codes  they appear to on the user interface but under the hood it never uses the pin. So it appears you send 20 or more pins to a device for instance, but in reality, it has only processed 3 or 4 of those pins.I still believe that the advice should be to all consumers to use a seven-digit or more pin code or complex password, as there is still unknown attacks from GrayKey which function in a similar manner. I was able to double check my work after speaking with Stefan Esser and Apple, it seems even though I was sending lots of PINs to the device, it only ever processed a small number of them due to this feature. Its intended to stop people pocket dialing and wiping their phones.The issue comes at a time when the debate over law enforcement unlocking iPhones is once again at a fever pitch. As a result of iOS 12s new security, companies like Cellebrite and Greyshift are working to make sure their core business  cracking open phones for law enforcement  stays intact.
