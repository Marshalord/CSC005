Minister for Law Enforcement and Cyber Security Angus Taylor has told the CeBIT Australia conference in Sydney on Thursday that the federal government's push to access encrypted communication is one of his highest priorities, but he refused to offer a date of when legislation can be expected.Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, along with his Questioning if the proposed legislation was technically possible, ZDNet asked the prime minister if the "The laws of Australia prevail in Australia, I can assure you of that," Turnbull told ZDNet. "The laws of mathematics are very commendable, but the only law that applies in Australia is the law of Australia."During his media rounds, Turnbull made sure he let Australia know his intention was to protect the nation from terrorism and criminal rings such as those involved in paedophilia, rather than nutting out the technical specs of the laws While no further detail was offered on Thursday, Taylor said the Coalition still intends to introduce legislation that would force companies to bend to the government's will.Pointing to the "95 percent of ASIOs most concerning counter-terrorism targets actively use encrypted messaging ... and 90 percent of data lawfully intercepted by the federal police use some form of encryption," the minister said.Taylor said Australian agencies predict that by 2020, most communications will be end-to-end encrypted."Let me be clear about this, we support strong encryption for the security of information and the protection of privacy. We firmly believe that cybersecurity will be enhanced by encryption -- it is a good thing," Taylor continued."But its near-ubiquitous use in the coming years poses a very serious threat for law enforcement and the Australian public have the right to expect a company operating in Australia will assist where they can -- within reason -- and that being the important qualifier, with lawful requests to access for data."Taylor said progressing the work on legislation that Turnbull announced in July is "one of my highest priorities"."The focus is on getting it right, not rushing it," Taylor said of the looming date of the legislation. "This is a big issue across the world, I'm speaking with agencies across the world ... we see encryption as crucial for cybersecurity."To weaken encryption as a means for supporting law enforcement that's not what we want ... I also think we can support law enforcement without breaking encryption." t tSeven months after Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told ZDNet the laws of Australia will trump the laws of mathematics, Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton has discussed looming legislation that would force companies to help the government access communications. t tRSA's VP and GM of Global Public Sector Practice Mike Brown believes there's a better way to thwart terrorism than breaking end-to-end encryption, as recently proposed by the Australian government. t tA prime minister that understands the seriousness of cybersecurity combined with cross-government and public-private information sharing initiatives has sent Australia to the fore, according to Minister for Law Enforcement and Cyber Security Angus Taylor. t tThe centre's chair has called for an overarching capability that supports federal, state, and territory-based cybercrime-countering efforts, labelling current capacities 'relatively weak'.
