As Kim Jong-un Experts from several cybersecurity firms  Dell SecureWorks, McAfee, Symantec, FireEye and Recorded Future  all told CyberScoop that activity from North Korea has stayed steady or grown in volume since peace talks gained steam earlier this year.The activities of these Similar to operations conducted prior to that date [circa January], North Korean actors have engaged in broad cyber espionage using a We have seen a heavy concentration of targeting in Southeast Asia and the United States, with some cross over into the Middle East, McAfee Senior Researcher Ryan Sherstobitoff said. We have even seen an entire countrys financial sector targeted by Hidden Cobra during this period.Hidden Cobra is one of the nicknames assigned by the U.S. government to North Koreas hacking activities; other names authored by the private sector include Lazarus Group, Blue Nortoff and Red Eyes.On Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation The group continues to use implants The findings, shared with CyberScoop, provide a stark reminder that North Korea remains highly dependent on cybercrime for both financial and geopolitical gain, so much so in that theyre willing to risk angering foreign governments amid a diplomatic push.During the past few months weve seen Lazarus conduct attacks on financial organizations, with the intention of attempting bank heists, said Vikram Thakur of Symantecs Security Response team. The volume of these attacks is not massive but the trend reflects a small uptick in overall attacks and attempts of financial fraud.The diplomatic talks regarding North Korea involve several key countries, including China, Russia, South Korea and the U.S. A number of research teams see the U.S. and South Korea still being targeted.During the timeframe, North Korea had been focusing their attention to South Korean targets, specifically North Korean defectors and related organizations for intelligence gathering, a spokesperson for SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit said. Based on targeting select victims, it appears that the [North Korean] government is keen to acquire information that could affect current peace process  We have not directly observed but are aware of phishing lures containing topics concerning current peace talks.North Koreas use of these diplomatically inspired phishing emails was not previously known.How the small, resource-strapped nation will move away from this type of behavior if it is to improve foreign partnerships is an open-ended question, experts say.The challenge is especially significant because of the decentralized nature of North Koreas hacking units. Prior DPRK cyber espionage operations continue to increase in scope and sophistication, developing new offensive capabilities and leveraging zero day vulnerabilities, said Cristiana Brafman Kittner, principal security analyst at FireEye. These financially motivated intrusions have continued during the run up to a potential Kim  Trump summit.On Wednesday, top North Korean and U.S. government officials met in Singapore to discuss next steps in the negotiations, according The meeting was held New Jersey-based cybersecurity firm Comodo saw an increase following a meeting between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Kim on May 9. Such detections could suggest one of two things: that the country is itself being hacked or that hackers inside North Korea are testing their own tools internally before operating abroad.A Comodo employee provided CyberScoop with a company presentation that showed this activity:Comodo has security software (and thus malware detections) inside North Korea, said Kenneth Geers, chief scientist at Comodo.In early MaySouth Koreas Financial Security Institute, a leading player in thwarting North Korean cyber aggression, did not respond to a request for comment.
